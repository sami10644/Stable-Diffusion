# Stable-Diffusion
StableDiffusion
An example usage of Stable Diffusion with a very small amount of code.

Usage : download the ipynb file and open it in Google Colab.

The notebook has been tested and was working correctly on a Google Colab session on 16/11/2022. I will try to update it if it ever runs into an issue because of a library update.

The present code is based on this work : https://huggingface.co/naclbit/trinart_stable_diffusion_v2

Have fun !
